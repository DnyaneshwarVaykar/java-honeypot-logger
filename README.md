# Java Honeypot Logger
# A lightweight Java-based honeypot that simulates a fake login service to attract attackers, capture attempts, and log suspicious activity for cybersecurity research.
The Java Honeypot Logger is a lightweight security project that simulates vulnerable services like web logins or SSH/FTP to attract and monitor unauthorized access attempts. It provides realistic login prompts, captures details such as attacker IP, port, attempted credentials, and timestamps, and stores them in CSV format for easy analysis. Designed to be extensible and safe to run in an isolated environment, it helps in learning network security monitoring, understanding attack patterns, and building a foundation for intrusion detection and defense strategies
